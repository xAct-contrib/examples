TODO description


[`Conformal_Transformation.nb`](../../raw/master/Conformal_Transformation.nb):
Tools to perform conformal transformations and examples. Adapted from a subpart of xPand's code.


[`EB-decomp-and-3+1-split.nb`](../../raw/master/EB-decomp-and-3+1-split.nb):
Examples of 3+1 decomposition applied to the Weyl tensor

A common usage pattern for varying a Lagrangian with respect to the metric to get Einstein equations


[`Raychaudhuri.nb`](../../raw/master/Raychaudhuri.nb):
Follows section 9.2 of Wald's book (General Relativity) on the Raychaudhuri equation for a congruence of timelike geodesics


[`SymManipulatorLovelockExample.nb`](../../raw/master/SymManipulatorLovelockExample.nb):
