Example xAct notebooks
========

This is a collection of example xAct notebooks that contain common xAct usage patterns.

**ActionVariation_Metric_Fields**
General function to vary a Lagrangian


**Angular-integration**
Example of angular integration on multiple direction vectors (adapted from Post-Newtonian computations)


**Bianchi_I_xCoBa**
Bianchi I Einstein equation using the CTensor framework of xCoBa


**Conformal_Transformation**
Examples of conformal transformations using the function Conformal[] implemented in xPand (for other reasons).

**EDGB-and-DCS-EOMs-and-C-tensors-simplified**
Getting equations of motion and simplifying "C-tensors" for Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and dynamical Chern-Simons theories


**FriedmannLemaitreMetric_CoordinatesApproach_xCoBa**
It shows how to define charts and specify the components of the metric so as to obtain the components of the related curvature tensors. Shows also how to change between different charts. Applied to homogeneous cosmology.


**Lagrangian-variation-xPert-VarD.nb**
A common usage pattern for varying a Lagrangian with respect to the metric to get Einstein equations


**Raychaudhuri**
Follows section 9.2 of Wald's book (General Relativity) on Raychaudhuri for null geodesics


**SymManipulatorLovelockExample**
Application of the Spinors and SymManipulator package to show the Lovelock tensor is non-dynamical.


**Warped-product**
Minimal example 1) creating a warped product geometry and 2) breaking down the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian into the effective lower-dimensional Lagrangian.
